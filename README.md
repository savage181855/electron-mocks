# electron-mocks
Mock various Electron classes for testing

This library is a collection of mocked/stubbed classes to replace various Electron classes during testing. 
It's still very rough, so please help contribute to help make this functionality more robust.

Currently implemented:
- MockBrowserWindow
- MockWebContents
- MockIpcMain
- MockIpcRenderer

All methods are implemented and should return logical values.

...more info coming soon.
